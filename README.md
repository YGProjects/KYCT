Know Your Climate &amp; Trees

Description :
Tress, Plants are intricately linked to each other and share a symbiotic relationship. Trees need the right climatic conditions to grow and give back by making the climate and natural ecosystem better. However not all trees and climates are complimentary. So while a particular tree may be beneficial for a certain region, it may not be so in another. Understanding the intricacies of climatic conditions of a place, species of a tree and their compatibility could be quite daunting. An application is needed to : 
1) Sense the climatic conditions around (heat, moisture, soil etc.).
2) Pull additional details from right sources e.g. USDA Hardiness Zones, water table, pollution details of the place. 
3) Suggest right trees to be planted with growth / care instructions based on the above information 
4) Given a plant species, the application should sense it and suggest its suitability to the sorrounding conditions.
5) The application should also provide quantitative and qualitative details on the benefits of the plant under given conditions. (e.g. quantity of oxygen provided, amount of pollutants absorbed, increase water table, attract xxx species of birds and animals etc. ) 

Inputs on the features of the application as well as design and implementation ideas for KYCT are most welcome.
