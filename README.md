Tress, Plants and climate of a place are intricately linked to each other and share a symbiotic relationship. Trees and plants need the right climatic conditions for growth and in return help flourish the climate and natural ecosystem. However not all trees and climates gel well. So while a particular tree may be suitable for a certain region, it may not be beneficial in another. Understanding these intricacies and compatibility could be quite daunting for non-specialists. To help them, an application can be build that can -

1. Sense the surrounding climatic conditions (sunlight, moisture, soil type etc.)
2. Pull additional details from other sources e.g. rainfall details, pollution levels, water table levels
3. Suggest right trees to be planted
4. Provide growth and care instructions relevant to the context

On another hand,

5. Given a plant species, the app should be able to identify it and suggest its suitability to the surrounding climate.
6. The app should also be able to examine its health and provide growth and care instructions.

This application can help:
1. Thousands of farmers in non-developed areas by connecting them and enabling them to choose the right crop, get crop health examined, know ways of crop care in a cost effective manner.

2. Ministries of Environment and Forests, Agriculture, Education and research institutes, NGOs in environment and climate protection initiatives.

3. Gardening Hobbyist , students, to know more about the plants and ecosystem.

4. Lenders, Insurance providers that cover crop/farm insurance.   

5. In longer term, if all relevant stakeholders in a country get connected e.g. farmers, agriculture/ forest officials,education and research institutes, financial institutions, the data and trends can be used in large number of areas for e.g. to predict crop yield that can be further used to decide crop price.

Inputs on additional features in the application and design and implementation ideas are most welcome.
